# vueTestingGround

A repository to test and learn Vue JS

This branch is about building a simple application also using CDN.\
Dismiss the SPA part I was going to do something with it, but I decided to do something else with this.

To see this simple application install the dependencies with `npm install`\
Then run it with `npm start`\
Then go to your browser at <http://localhost:3000>
